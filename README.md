Welcome to the contributed project for YaPSNapp.
You can collaborate to this project for
* Translating the app *(if you want to see your favorite app in your native language)*
* Define some new application theme(s) that we will be able to release for everyone

## Translation

Several things to do for each language:

* Select the language for which you want to contribute, here are the priority languages:
	* en_US (Credits: Drakfly)
	* fr_FR (Credits: Drakfly)
	* es_ES (Credits: Drakfly)
    * pt_PT (Credits: Diogo Vidigal)
    * zh_CN --- Not yet translated
    * it_IT --- Not yet translated
    * de_DE --- Not yet translated
	
You can amend this language list by adding additional languages (by creating sub-folder accordingly)
	
* There are 2 files by language
    + 1 page "Localization.strings" where you must change the labels / messages used in YaPSNapp iOS App
    + 1 page "AppStore.txt" where you must specify the application description for the Application store (AppStore / PlayStore)

## Design

If you want to create a new YaPSNapp theme for a future release, you can create a new Theme with its schemes by creating a new XML file.
Just copy an existing "Stock" theme file and change what you want.
*Note that with a jailbroken phone you can browse the YaPSNapp Documents/theme directory to retrieve the XML file you have customized through the App*
